# Homework 0: Course Setup

**Recommended Due Date:** Friday, September 4, 2020 

This is an *optional, but highly recommended* assignment. It will cover the necessary steps to get set up for the semester.  There is nothing to submit, but there are review questions listed so that you can assess your own understanding.

*For this assignment only -- you may ask others in the class for help with these setup tasks. Please use Piazza and post in the `homework` folder for these questions so that others may benefit from the answers.*

## ODU-CS Linux

We will be using the [ODU-CS Linux systems](https://systems.cs.odu.edu/Unix_and_Linux_Services) for part of the course (read the information in the linked webpage). If you do not already have an account, request one at https://accounts.cs.odu.edu/validate/

If you are not familiar with Unix/Linux systems, I strongly encourage you to read the materials from [CS 252 - Unix for Programmers](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~zeil/cs252/latest/Directory/outline/index.html). 

**Q1.** Create a directory for files for this course (name it whatever you wish, but something like `cs432-f20` or `cs532-f20` is probably a good idea). Change the permissions on this directory so that you are the only user who can read, write, or execute (view the contents) the directory.

## Python

You can use Python 3 on the ODU-CS Linux machines *(make sure to use /usr/bin/python3 and **not** /usr/bin/python)* or you can [download it ](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and run on your local machine.  Review some of the [important differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/important-differences-between-python-2-x-and-python-3-x-with-examples/).

**Q2.** Practice executing a Python program on the ODU-CS machines. Pick one of the "Python Strings" examples from [Python examples](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_examples.asp), save it to a file in the directory you created in **Q1**, and execute it using Python 3.

## Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a project to host Python-based [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the cloud.  We'll look at many of our Python (and R) examples using this service.  For more information about Google Colab, see their [FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html).

Make sure you're logged into a Google account (either a personal one or your ODU student account) and open [Overview of Colaboratory Features](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). Walk through and execute the examples shown.  Experiment with changing some of the code and re-execute the cells.

**Q3.** Create a new cell in the notebook and copy in and execute the code you used in **Q2**.

## Git, GitHub

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in source code, used in the popular [GitHub](https://github.com) code hosting platform.  To become familiar with the basics of Git, read [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).

If you do not have one already, you must create a GitHub account.  I recommend a username that incorporates at least part of your actual name (e.g., mine is [weiglemc](https://github.com/weiglemc)).

Mr. Thomas Kennedy has a nice introduction and walkthrough of Git available.  Read through [his materials](https://git-community.cs.odu.edu/tkennedy/git-workshop/-/wikis/Git-Workshop) and work through all of the exercises in the "Setting Up a Local Git Repository" section to create a repository, make changes, commit them locally, and then create a remote repo at GitHub.

**Q4.** What is your GitHub username?

**Q5.** What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is widely used in GitHub, especially for README pages.  

Here are some helpful links for Markdown (and GitHub-flavored Markdown):
* [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
* [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github) -- it can be slightly different than regular Markdown
  * [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (GitHub flavor)

**Q6.** Complete the following tasks:
* a) Create an ordered list with at least 3 items
* b) Write a paragraph that demonstrates the use of *italics*, **bold**, ***bold italics***, and `inline code`.
* c) Create an example of a fenced code block.
* d) Create a level 4 heading

## LaTeX and Overleaf

LaTeX is *the* markup language for academic publication. [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) provides an online setup for writing and compiling LaTeX into PDF.  

Sign up for a free [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com) account.

Walk through [part 1](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)) and [part 2](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_2)) of this [LaTeX introduction](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Free_online_introduction_to_LaTeX_(part_1)). 

**Q7.** What environment is used for bulleted lists?  What command is used to start a bulleted list?

**Q8.** What is the command to include an image in a LaTeX file?
