# Homework 5 - Graph Partitioning
**Due:** Sunday, November 13, 2022 by 11:59pm

Read through the entire assignment before starting.

## Assignment 

This assignment will have you investigate the split of the Karate Club (Zachary, 1977), described starting on [slide 92 in the Module-07 Social Networks lecture slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G9bY32EslxRdIq7znDZoGJd3-_Ock1FeJcqN3QgQuy4/edit#slide=id.g7e0acafd7b_0_0).  You must use a Python or JavaScript library (as discussed in [Module-09 Graph Vis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M_c2CKSnVS9fe-1vAfV4sac6KoZ36KdknFiYBL575uw/edit?usp=sharing)) to generate the graphs required in this assignment.

Write a report that answers and *explains how you arrived at the answers* to the following questions.  Be sure to address any questions that are asked (indicated by "*Q: ...?*" in italics). Include any interesting findings that you discover from your analysis.
 
Before starting, review the [HW report guidelines](https://github.com/odu-cs432-websci/public/blob/main/fall22/getting-started/reports.md).  Name your report for this assignment `HW5-report` with the proper file extension.  Do not edit this file (`README.md`).

### Q1. Color nodes based on final split

Draw the original Karate club graph (before the split) and color the nodes according to the factions they belong to (John A or Mr. Hi).  This should look similar to the graph on slide 92 - all edges should be present, just indicate the nodes in the eventual split by color.

*Q: How many nodes eventually go with John and how many with Mr. Hi?*

### Q2. Use the Girvan-Newman algorithm to illustrate the split

We know the "real" result of the Karate Club split, which you've colored in Q1. Your task is to use the Girvan-Newman algorithm to show that this result of the split could have been predicted by the weighted graph of social interactions.  How well does the mathematical model represent reality?  Generously document your answer with all supporting equations, code, graphs, arguments, etc.

Keeping the node colors the same as they were in Q1, run multiple iterations of the Girvan-Newman graph partioning algorithm (see Module-07 Social Networks, slides 90-99) on the Karate Club graph until the graph splits into two connected components. Include an image of the graph after each iteration in your report.  

Note that you will have to implement the Girvan-Newman algorithm rather than relying on a built-in function, as a built-in function will automatically run the whole algorithm and you will not be able to view the intermediate graphs.  Make sure that you explain in your report what the Girvan-Newman algorithm is doing.

*Q: How many iterations did it take to split the graph?*  

### Q3. Compare the actual to the mathematical split

Compare the connected components of the Girvan-Newman split graph (Q2) with the connected components of the actual split Karate club graph (Q1). 

*Q: Did all of the same colored nodes end up in the same group?  If not, what is different?*

## Extra Credit

### Q4. *(1 point)*
We know the group split in two different groups.  Suppose the disagreements in the group were more nuanced.  What would the clubs look like if they split into 3, 4, and 5 groups?  A single node can be considered as a "group".

### Q5. 
Use D3.js's force-directed graph layout to draw the Karate Club Graph before the split. Color the nodes according to the factions they belong to (John A or Mr. Hi). After a button is clicked, split the graph based on the original graph split. Include a link to the HTML/JavaScript files (or Observable notebook) in your report and all necessary screenshots.
* If you load a new file containing the split upon button press, this EC is worth 2 points.
* If you modify the nodes and edges using D3 (without loading a new file), this EC is worth 4 points.
* If you use D3 transitions to move the nodes and edges to their new locations, this EC is worth 6 points.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  Your repo should contain any code you developed to answer the questions.  Include "Ready to grade @faryaneh @Kritikagarg" in your final commit message.
